# Prediction of Specific Heat Capacity of Organic Molecules
Welcome to the "Prediction of Specific Heat Capacity of Organic Molecules" project repository! This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict the specific heat capacity of organic molecules. The primary script, `StackModelGroupContributions.ipynb`, showcases the implementation of stacked ensemble learning, combining predictions from multiple models for enhanced accuracy.

## Project Overview
- **File:** `StackModelGroupContributions.ipynb` serves as the main Jupyter notebook containing the machine learning models and code for predicting the specific heat capacity of organic molecules.

- **Ensemble Learning:** Stacked ensemble learning is employed in this project, utilizing various machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting Regressor, Artificial Neural Network (MLP), and Support Vector Regressor. The meta-model, a Random Forest Regressor, combines predictions from these individual models to improve overall accuracy.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdul-anwar/MLHeatCapacityPredictor.git
   cd MLHeatCapacityPredictor

Open the Jupyter notebook StackModelGroupContributions.ipynb to explore the machine learning models and the implementation of stacked ensemble learning.

Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the models, input data, and obtain predictions.

Stacked Ensemble Learning:

Stacked ensemble learning involves combining predictions from multiple models to create a meta-model, enhancing predictive performance and robustness.

The notebook demonstrates how stacked ensemble learning is applied to predict the specific heat capacity of organic molecules, leveraging the strengths of individual models.

Additional Information:

This project explores variations of the main model, including those utilizing only molecular weight or incorporating molecular weight and acentric factor as inputs.

The repository also includes models and files for validation and optimization purposes, providing a comprehensive overview of the project's evolution.

Feel free to contribute, experiment with different configurations, or use this code as a foundation for your own projects. Happy predicting!
